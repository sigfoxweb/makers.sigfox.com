<h1>OTIO to Connect 1 Million Devices to the SIGFOX Global Internet of Things Network</h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/otio.jpg"></div><p><b>Otio </b></p><b>

</b><p>BARCELONA – Feb. 22, 2016 – OTIO, a subsidiary of Groupe HBF specializing in electrical equipment, lighting and home automation, has chosen the SIGFOX network to deploy its new international offer of connected devices.</p>

<p>Groupe HBF, which commercializes wireless home-automation and security equipment

under its OTIO brand, has sold 6 million devices in retail and specialty stores. With its

leading experience in smart-home solutions, Groupe HBF is developing a new range of

connected objects using the SIGFOX network, which is dedicated to the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Connected devices from the OTIO ALERT product line detect domestic incidents such as

smoke or carbon monoxide emissions, dramatic temperature changes, power failure or

house intrusion, and immediately inform users by SMS.</p>

<p>After a successful test of the technology, Groupe HBF and SIGFOX, the world’s leading

provider of communications service dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT), have signed

an international connectivity contract for 1 million OTIO ALERT devices, initially focusing

on the French, Spanish and German markets.</p>

<p>Groupe HBF will benefit from the quality of service available in the SIGFOX network, which

is available nationwide in France and Spain. SIGFOX, which offers the widest IoT network

coverage in the world and recently announced its deployment in Germany, will accelerate

the international deployment of the OTIO ALERT offer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OTIO ALERT line will include a hundred different products by 2020, designed by the

R&D center of the brand, in close collaboration with an ecosystem of startups and 

technology partners deployed around SIGFOX and Groupe HBF.</p>

<p>Designed and assembled in France, OTIO’s SIGFOX ReadyTM certified products will be

available beginning in September 2016. The SIGFOX ReadyTM certification ensures 

compatibility of the devices on the entire SIGFOX network and seamless connectivity for 

users.</p>

<p>By providing access to a wide range of partners that provide radio components for

connected-object manufacturers, SIGFOX offers the only low-throughput and low-power 

IoT communication service capable of sustaining industrial production of devices required 

for large-scale commercialization of IoT applications.</p>

<p>"SIGFOX is the only IoT network company capable of receiving a product offer that could 

be made available in retail businesses in multiple countries," said Marc Bergougnoux, 

general manager of Groupe HBF. "Beyond the quality of the network we have seen, it is 

also, and above all, the strength of the SIGFOX business model that attracted us: one 

contract, no concept of roaming, for the deployment of an international and competitive 

offer."</p>

<p>"We are proud to support OTIO in its strategy of international development, and

strengthen its position as an innovative company in the 14 countries where we are already

present," said Stuart Lodge, SIGFOX executive vice president, global sales and partners.

"The new OTIO ALERT offer perfectly illustrates the competitive advantages of SIGFOX

connectivity: very long battery life and a solution that does not require local Internet

connectivity, which is a real advantage compared to existing home-automation devices.

As soon as the battery is inserted in the object, it is immediately connected to the

network."</p>
